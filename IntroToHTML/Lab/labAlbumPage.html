    <h1>The Joshua Tree</h1>
    <h2>U2</h2>
    <h3>09 March 1987</h3>
    <p>
      The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band U2.
      It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987
      on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release
      The Unforgettable Fire, the band aimed for a harder-hitting sound within the
      limitation of conventional song structures on The Joshua Tree.
      The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music, and depicts the band's
      loveâ€“hate relationship with the United States, using socially and politically
      conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery.
